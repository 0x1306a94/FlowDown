# FlowDown Community

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in building your own version of FlowDown.

## Open Source Components

While we have open-sourced all our code, please note the following important details:

Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot distribute certain frameworks directly in this repository. To successfully build the project, you will need to:

- Obtain the required third-party frameworks independently
- Package them as Swift Packages where necessary
- Ensure you're using compatible versions
- Address any potential version compatibility issues

You will likely need to source components from:

- swiftlang/swift-cmark
- gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui
- ktiays/NumericTransitionLabel

These additional steps are necessary to comply with licensing requirements while still making our source code available to you.

## License Restrictions

Please note that the original FlowDown icon (the white pigeon) is **not** licensed for redistribution. You are not permitted to use this icon in your implementations.

Good luck with your project!

If you are unable to resolve the issue yourself, you might as well start learning programming with Swift.

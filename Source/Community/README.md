# FlowDown Community

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in building your own version of FlowDown.

## Open Source Components

While we have open-sourced all our code, please note the following important details:

Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot distribute certain frameworks directly in this repository. To successfully build the project, you will need to:

- Obtain the required third-party frameworks independently
- Package them as Swift Packages where necessary
- Ensure you're using compatible versions
- Address any potential version compatibility issues

You will likely need to source components from:

- swiftlang/swift-cmark
- gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui
- ktiays/NumericTransitionLabel

These additional steps are necessary to comply with licensing requirements while still making our source code available to you.

## License Restrictions

Please note that the original FlowDown icon (the white pigeon) is **not** licensed for redistribution. You are not permitted to use this icon in your implementations.

Good luck with your project!
